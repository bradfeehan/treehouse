## Tool Use

There are a few tools available that can be invoked as necessary. Don't be afraid to use them anytime.

### Tidewave

Tidewave lets you interact directly with the running Phoenix app.

- `get_logs` retrieves recent logs from the running server
- `get_source_location` determines which file a module or function lives in
- `get_package_location` determines where a dependency package lives on disk
- `project_eval` allows evaluating Elixir code in the server, including `h` helper
- `execute_sql_query` allows running arbitrary SQL queries against the database
- `get_ecto_schemas` reports on the database schema as seen by Ecto in the server
- `list_liveview_pages` lists all currently connected Phoenix LiveViews

There's also tools to search for documentation:

- `get_docs` shows help text for modules and functions, including for dependencies
- `search_package_docs` searches Hex documentation for packages in dependencies
